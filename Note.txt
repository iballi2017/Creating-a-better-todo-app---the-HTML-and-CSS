This project is designed by following the process in the tutorial video title "Creating a better todo app - the HTML and CSS" by Kelvin Powell on Youtube.

A todo list app interface was created. Though the project layout is not responsive, but I gain alot of CSS tricks from it.

My favourite moment was creating a custom checkbox, this has been my dream and i'm happy for the experience
